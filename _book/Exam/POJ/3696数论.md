multiple意为倍数。
##题意：

Chinese people think of '8' as the lucky digit.

Bob also likes digit '8'. Moreover, Bob has his own lucky number L.

Now he wants to construct his luckiest number which is the minimum among all positive integers that are a multiple of L and consist of only digit '8'.


中国人认为8是幸运数。Bog也喜欢8。此外，Bob还有他自己的幸运数L。现在他想要构建他自己的幸运数字（只在所有正数中，且是L的倍数，仅仅包含数字8）.

##输入输出分析：
###Input:
The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains exactly one line containing L(1 ≤ L ≤ 2,000,000,000).

The last test case is followed by a line containing a zero.

测试数据以0结束， L最大值为2 000 000 000

###output:
For each test case, print a line containing the test case number( beginning with 1) followed by a integer which is the length of Bob's luckiest number.

If Bob can't construct his luckiest number, print a zero.

如果Bob无法构建这样一个数字，输出0。
输出每一组测试数据的case number（从1开始）

####sample input:
8
11
16
0
####sample output:
Case 1: 1

Case 2: 2

Case 3: 0
